# Working-with-Hotel-Booking-Demand
Using Python via Jupyter Notebook to explore through a dataset - Hotel Booking Demand dataset.

In Phase 1 - Business Understanding -- Business problem: predicting cancellations, dataset: hotel booking demand, and Proposed Analytics Solution: several models that used information-based learning 
that will focus on features that have the most effect on the target variable. 

In Phase 2 - Data Exploration and Pre-processing 
Cleaning up the data, such as getting rid of outliers and normalization, to move on to the next phase.

In Phase 2 - Model Selection and Evaluation.
Selecting which models to run, in this case decision tree, logistic regression, and random forest, and then evaluating them.

The pdf is the final report and includes my findings and which model is best solution.
